# Static Comp 2
This repo is for Mod 1 project Static Comp 2, an exercise in HTML and CSS.

## Project Goals
The primary goal of this project is to practice building a complex UI and using Grid to do so. While not exactly difficult, this comp was pretty time-consuming and could get a little tedious at times, but I enjoyed having a non-JS project to take a break with when other schoolwork was hurting my feelings.

## Accomplishments
I am pleased with my approximation of the comp layout - I'm less comfortable with Grid than Flexbox, so after struggling a little I finally bent it to my will. The SVG animations were also a win. Breaking down each part of what is some pretty intimidating code (numbers! eek!) made it feel more like fun and less like scary.

## Challenges
That SVG code, holy cow. I don't feel 100% comfortable with SVGs, but I certainly feel better and like I can step through basic keyframes animations and understand what an SVG is doing. The checkboxes, on the other hand, can set themselves on fire. After struggling to get them styled properly, the checkboxes were no longer checkable. I finally gave up and accepted that I'd rather have them functioning than colored.

## Takeaways
CSS is fun! And a pain! And the lesser evil when you need a break from JavaScript. Organization became a challenge as the CSS began to pile up, so I continue to learn the lesson of using thoughtful (and scalable) naming conventions.
